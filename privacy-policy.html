                            <p>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</p>
                            <p>When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:

Location Information: When you use the Services for delivery of goods, we collect precise location data about the Delivery of goods from the Callat7 app used by the Courier. If you permit the Callat7 app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
</p>
							<p>Contacts Information: If you permit the Callat7 app to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.</p>

                            <p>Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. </p>
                            <p>Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and various, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</p>

                        	<p style="font-weight:bold;">Important Information About Platform Permissions</p>
							<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Callat7 app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Callat7 app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent. To learn about the platform-level permissions that the app seeks, please visit our new iOS Permissions page and Android Permissions page. Sometimes these permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves provide, and the permissions we request will change over time, so we’ve created these pages to serve as authoritative and up-to-date resources for our users.</p>

                            <p>When you request on demand services, our Couriers may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.</p>
                            <p>If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Courier or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your capacity as a User </p>
